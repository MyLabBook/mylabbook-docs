Each page will have a purpose (we hope) and serve it well. As you have seen after the default installation of Oqtane, you are even given a home page to work with on the first load of your new site. Your next step might be to create additional pages, such as About Us, Contact Us, and more. As your site continues to become successful and grows to meet the needs of your customers and other visitors, you will undoubtedly begin to have more and more pages on your site. You'll have so many that at some point you will need to manage them from a centralized location. In other cases, you might have pages that are hidden from the menu and are not easily accessible. This is where the Page Management feature comes in to allow for a larger overview of the pages on your website, with all pages on your website viewable in a list format. These pages can be manipulated in the page manager by being able to add, edit, and delete pages. Add The add feature adds a new page to your website and brings up the page management window, which allows you to specify the settings, appearance, and permissions for the page you are adding. The fields which exist in the page management window are the: Settings Name: Which specifies the name that will be displayed in the navigation bar.

The Recycle Bin allows you to restore the content in most cases, which can save you time and frustration. The Recycle Bin has two types of objects that can be restored, Pages and Modules. When you delete a page or a module, it will show up in the respective list. You can switch which list you're looking at by clicking the tabs at the top of the page. Clicking retore on one of the pages or modules will allow you to restore the selected item to their original place in your site. The recycle bin feature has two options, restore and delete.

Just remember that Security Roles can be used for content targeting, editing, and hiding sections of your site. Security Roles work the same as most permissions-based systems, such as Windows. You first create a Security Role if it doesn't already exist to create a grouping of users. Then, you add one or more people to that group. Once you do that minimal setup, you can apply that group to various capabilities, permissions, and features. Permissions are set when creating or editing pages and modules by selecting which roles can edit or view them. At the top of the page is the add role btton that allows for the addition of a new group you want to make, with a name, description, and saying if it should be automatically assigned to users. You can edit, delete, and manage users in each role except for the default administrator and registered users roles which you cannot edit or delete, you can only manage their users. When adding a user into a role, there are fields for effective date and expiry date, which determines when a user will be added to a roles and how long they will be inside of a role."

It is worth noting that the Control Panel you'll be using is the one that ships “out of the box” with MyLabBook. However, it is one of numerous extension points in MyLabBook. Like modules, themes, and other extensions, the Control Panel can be replaced with a custom or third-party alternative."

Configure Apache For a publicly facing website, we assume that you have registered the domain example.com for your instance of MyLabBook. If you are running on a local computer we assume that you are using localhost. To set up apache, you will need to create a config file for the website. This file will initially be placed in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory. An example config file follows, where of course you should replace example.com with your own domain name. We call this example.conf, but you should use a name that corresponds to your actual domain. Note that apache expects the file to end with .conf. <VirtualHost *:*> RequestHeader set \"X-Forwarded-Proto\" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME} </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost *:80> ProxyPreserveHost On ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:44357/ ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:44357/ RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{HTTP:UPGRADE} ^WebSocket$ [NC] RewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} Upgrade$ [NC] RewriteRule /(.*) ws://127.0.0.1:44357/$1 [P] ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com ServerName example.com ServerAlias *.example.com ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined </VirtualHost> After this file is created, use the following command to enable it. sudo a2enmod example.conf Restart the apache server with the following command. cd sudo Also, you should set the /etc/hosts file with the appropriate entry 127.0.0.1 example.com To setup the SSL so that you can hae your site at https://example.com , then you can use the https://letsencrypt.org service for Apache on Ubuntu.

    "keywords": "Adding Modules to a Page To add a module to a page, open the control panel . The bottom section of the control panel provides three module management drop-downs along with some other text fields. The choices for these drop downs and text fields will determine the module and its settings that are added to the current page when the \"Add Module to Page\" button is clicked. As shown in the annotated screenshot below, for the three drop downs starting from the top, we will call them the \"Mode\", \"Group\" and \"Module\" choices. The first drop-down \"Mode\" choice will determine the overall settings of the module that is added to the page. Options for first \"Mode\" drop-down are as follows. Add New Module - Add a module with no preset values except what is set in the control panel Add Existing Module - Add a module from another page using its already preset values Add New Module Option When the \"Add New Module\" is selected from the first \"Mode\" drop-down, then the options for the second \"Group\" drop down will be Admin Modules , Common Modules , and Developer Modules . Once a second \"Group\" drop-down choice is made, then only the modules that belong to that group are displayed in the third \"Module\" drop-down. Whatever module is then selected in the third \"Module\" drop-down will be the module that is added when the content manager clicks the \"Add Module to Page\" button at the bottom of the control panel.

If this is left blank then the module's name will be used as the title. Pane - Select which content pane you want the module to go inside of. Panes should be visible when the page is in edit mode . Container - Select if you would like to have a title displayed above the module or not have one. Visibility - Options are \"Page Editors Only\" or \"Same As Page\" Add Existing Module Option When the \"Add Existing Module\" is selected from the first \"Mode\" drop-down, then the options for the second \"Group\" drop down will display all of the current pages in the site. Choosing any page in this second \"Group\" drop down will cause only the modules that are used in the selected page to be displayed in the third \"Module\" drop-down. Whatever module is then selected in the third \"Module\" drop-down will be the module that is added when the content manager clicks the \"Add Module to Page\" button at the bottom of the control panel. The key difference here is that the values that were used for that module on the existing page will also be used for the module being inserted on the current page. In other words, inserting the module in this page is like using a reference to the same module on the other page. This option can increase efficiency and good practices for many situations. Say, for example, you have an HTML module that holds a banner image and you want that banner image to also exist on five specific pages in your site. Instead of adding a new module to all five of those pages and then inserting the same image, you can simply go into the Module Management section of the Control Panel and click \"Add an Existing Module\" and select the existing module on an existing page. A content manager can then make edits in one module and instantly have those edits reflected across every page on which the module is shared. The text boxes after the drop-downs allow you to set the following fields for the module. Title - Set the text that will be displayed directly above the module. This text will override the title of the existing module. If this is left blank then the referenced module's title will be used. Pane - Select which content pane you want the module to go inside of. Panes should be visible when the page is in edit mode . Container - Select if you would like to have a title displayed above the module or not have one.

You can also create your own custom modules for your site or for use by other MyLabBook sites. Modules on Pages Modules can be placed onto pages from the control panel in locations called “panes”. These panes are defined by the theme's designer. These themes dictate the overall look and feel of your site and are often created by a front-end designer. Panes can span the full width of the page or be positioned in a column fashion. It may be helpful to think of panes as windows in the design of the site where you can drop in modules. You can move modules around the panes when in edit mode . An example of a page in edit mode with the panes displayed is shown below."

Moving Modules Once a module is on the page, you can move its location again if needed. All that is needed is to enter the content editor by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right hand side with editing permission on a certain page. And then selecting the small downward pointing arrow in the top left of the module to do a variety of things to it, including: Move to Top: Moves the modules to the top of the page to be the first module displayed. Move Up: Moves the module up to be above the module above it. Move Down: Move the module down below the module beneath it. Move to Bottom: Moves the module to the bottom of the page, below all other modules.

By clicking on the pencil icon, you can edit the content of the current page. This provides a very user-friendly and intuitive approach to managing content. Whenever you want to edit content in Oqtane, just go to the location where the content resides and edit it right there in place. There are different aspects to editing the current page. First of all, there are some common features that are available to all modules on a page. The common features are described below under the headings of Managing Modules and Moving Modules. Each module on the page may also have other features for editing as well. For example, the HTML Editor Module is commonly used on pages and includes an Edit button, as highlighted in red in the screenshot below. Notice that the screenshot also displays a reminder for the locations of the available panes when placing modules on a page. The available panes are determined by the template that is used for this page. Managing Modules If you are in edit mode and modules have been placed on a page, then you can view a module drop-down menu for each of the modules. Select the small downward pointing arrow in the top left of the module to display a drop-down menu that allows you to perform a variety of operations, as shown in the screenshot below. The first 5 options in the module drop-down menu are described below. Manage Settings - Brings up the module's settings and permissions which allow you to change the following. Title - The title displayed above the module. Container - Specify if you want the title to be displayed for the module. Display on All Pages - Choose whether you want this module to be on every page on the site. Page - Change the page that the module is displayed on. Permissions - Specify either what roles or individual users should be able to view or edit the page. Unpublish Module - Hides the module from everyone but the site administrators for instances where you want to edit modules. Delete Module - Deletes the module from the page. Import Content - Enter a file's address to import it into the module, such as a image address to include it. Export Content - Enter a file address to select where to export data from a module. Moving Modules The next set of options in the module drop-down menu may be different depending on the location of the module in the template. These possible options are described below. Move to Top - Moves the modules to the top of the page so that it is the first module displayed. Move Up - Moves the module up once so that it is displayed above the module above it. Move Down - Move the module down once so that it is displayed below the module beneath it. Move to Bottom - Moves the module to the bottom of the page, below all other modules. If the page has the layout for multiple panes, which allows for three center rows and a top and bottom row that can have content inserted into them, then there will be additional options available which are described below. Move to Top Pane - Moves the module to the content pane at the top of the page. Move to Left Pane - Moves the module to the left-most column. Move to Right Pane - Moves the module to the right-most column. Move to Content Pane - Moves the module to the central column. Move to Bottom Pane - Moves the module to the pane at the bottom of the page."

These tasks are described more fully in the following sections. File Management - Offers folder add and edit capabilities. Offers file upload, delete and edit capabilities. Language Management - Manages language translations used on pages of the site. Page Management - Lists all the website pages and offers add, edit, and delete capabilities. Profile Management - Specifies custom fields for the user profiles. Recycle Bin - Offers features similar to the recycle bin on a desktop operating system. Used for deleted pages and modules.

Visitor Management - Displays records of login metadata for all website visitors. Administration Flexibility A Site Administrator has access to all of the features linked above when they are given the Administrators role. However it is also possible to create Site administration can take on many forms, but there are two use cases that you should be familiar with. First, there's site administration as defined by Oqtane.You enable this by adding the Administrators security role as one of the assigned roles for the account. That way, all “admin” features will be available for that user across that specific site. Site administration can take on a hybrid of another sort as well, where you as the site administrator can define a different kind of administration for your site. This would be a kind of administration where you define a subset of administration capabilities and assign them to more privileged users to avoid having to make them an actual administrator. As an example, there may be times when you want to create a security role in the role manager that might be named something like Site Admin. You would then create a page or pages on the site that contain some of the Admin modules, assigning permission to the newly created Site Admin security role so that only participants of that security role can see them. In these areas, you can also add references or links to features that normally require Administrator permissions, provided you set up your permissions properly in those other areas and that the chosen feature(s) allows this. In summary, you can perform all of the configuration and content management tasks that you need to in order to run your own site."

Each page will have a purpose (we hope) and serve it well. As you have seen after the default installation of Oqtane, you are even given a home page to work with on the first load of your new site. Your next step might be to create additional pages, such as About Us, Contact Us, and more. As your site continues to become successful and grows to meet the needs of your customers and other visitors, you will undoubtedly begin to have more and more pages on your site. You'll have so many that at some point you will need to manage them from a centralized location. In other cases, you might have pages that are hidden from the menu and are not easily accessible. This is where the Page Management feature comes in to allow for a larger overview of the pages on your website, with all pages on your website viewable in a list format. These pages can be manipulated in the page manager by being able to add, edit, and delete pages. Add The add feature adds a new page to your website and brings up the page management window, which allows you to specify the settings, appearance, and permissions for the page you are adding. The fields which exist in the page management window are the: Settings Name: Which specifies the name that will be displayed in the navigation bar. Parent: Which will specify the page that this page will be underneath, meaning that the added page will be put to the right of the page specified in the navigation bar at the top. Insert: Specify where the name for the page will appear in the navigation bar, by saying where the page should appear among all of the children of the parent that has been selected. Navigation: Say whether you want the page to be displayed to users that fit within the permissions, or if you want the page to be hidden to everyone but administrators which can be useful while editing a page. URL Path: The url is what is put in the web page's address, for example if the url path is set to page1 then the address might be www.website/page1.com. If no URL path is specified then the URL will by default be set to be the same as the name field above. Redirect: Input a URL that is the same as the URL path of another page in the site that user will be sent to, remember that if no URL path is specified for another page then the name will be used. If this feature is implemented then you will not be able stay on the page to use the control panel's page manager, so you will need to edit or delete page's with this feature. Appearance Title: The name that is displayed on the web page's tab. Theme: The theme that the web page will take on. In the admin dashboard's theme management feature you can see more information on these theme and import new themes to be used. Default Container: Choose the layout of modules for the page, like hw the titles typically displayed above the modules will be. Icon: Input a favicon address or other icon address to include an icon beside the name of your page. Personalizable: This feature gives a page that is unique to every individual and allows them to add modules and edit the content of the page, so only the individual can see what they put onto the page. Permissions View: This is what allows different users to see certain pages and any users that are within certain roles, that can be specified in the admin dashboard's role management feature will be able to see or not see the page depending on what you have checked the box for the role they fit into. Edit: This allows users that fit into the specified roles to be able to edit pages using the content editor. Specific Users: The permissions tab also has the ability for you to enter a specific username and allow for you to set custom permissions for any specific users that you want. Edit The edit feature shares all of the same features as the add feature, allowing you to change the settings, appearances, and permissions of any page, with the insert feature being replaced by the move feature. The edit feature also shows you when a page was created and when the page was last edited at the bottom of the page management window.

How Users Are Referred To in This Documentation In order to maintain consistency and to minimize any confusion with the value used for the roles ( Host Users , Administrators , and Registered Users ), we refer in this documentation to users according to their set of permissions. The sets of permission are described below. Host Administrator - A site user who has the Host Users role. The Host Administrator has the most powerful set of permissions and is meant for manging the instance of Oqtane as a whole. The Host Administrator can edit all Oqtane host settings as well as any of the site settings within the Oqtane instance and any of the pages within the Oqtane instance. The actions that a Host Administrator takes are under the Host Administration section. Site Administrator - A site user who has the Administrators role. The Site Administrator can edit all of the site settings for the site where it is given the Administrators role. The Site Administrator can also edit any of the pages within the site where it has the Administrators role. The actions that a Site Administrator takes are under the Site Administration section. Administrators - Refers to a user who has either the Host Administrator or Site Administrator level of permissions. When setting permissions for page viewing and editing, both Host Administrators and Site Administrators are grouped together as Administrators. In this documentation, when referring to Administrators, we are referring to those with either the Host Administration or the Site Administration set of permissions. Registered User - Refers to a site user who has been given the Registered User role. By default, this role does not have any special permissions, and by default it is not automatically assigned to a new user. However, as is the case for all roles, it can be used for setting permissions for managing pages and modules. Content Editor - Refers to a site user who has permissions to edit the content of a given page or extend the page with a module. Note that this permission for a page can be assigned to either a custom role or to an individual user. Assigning and Using Security Roles From the User Management screen, an Administrator can assign a role to a user. The security roles can be used in different ways according to the needs of your website. For pages , roles can determine whether a page or groups of pages can be viewed or edited. For modules , a role can determine whether the module can be seen or not when adding a module to a page or whether content of a given module can be edited. In general, security roles can be used for content management, content editing, and hiding sections of your site. Security roles work in a similar way to most permissions-based systems, for example Windows. You can assign users to one or more of the default or custom security roles. You can apply a role to the management or editing of pages or modules. The screenshot below shows checkboxes for setting permissions for a page . Setting permissions for a module is similar. The checkboxes determine which roles can edit or view a page or module. In addition, the bottom textbox allows the user to assign permissions to a certain user."

You might also be required to add and remove abilities from users on your site. Everything that you need to do in these examples can be done from this one menu. The options that are provided on this user manager includes: Add User: The add new user button is exactly what it sounds like it allows you to add a new user to your site and upon being clicked, it brings up a window that asks for all of the essential information for an account with a username, password, email, and full name. There is also the profile tab which allows for more extensive information to be provided for a user account and may have some fields that are required to be input in order to create an account, which is specified in the required field of the profile manager . Find User: Provides a text field to input a user's account name that will search through all of the site's users and return the account below this ield with the following options: Edit User: This allows for basic fields in the identity field such as password, email, and full name to be modified as well as the ability to give the user a profile image and the profile tab to specify more information about a user. There is also the profile tab which goes into more detail about a user allowing for the specification of things like postal code, phone number and address. Delete User: This is exactly as it sounds, it will delete the user's account. User Roles: This allows for a user account to placed into a security role that has been previously defined in the role manager , and requires a date that this security role will take effect and will expire for the user account."

    "keywords": "MyLabBook Development The main approach to customizing Oqtane is to create or import custom modules. The easiest way to create a custom module is to use the custom module builder that is included by default in Oqtane. This will provide a basic framework for a working custom module. But that working custom module is limited. The default module provides the ability for the user to create one or more items. Each item has a Name string. The created items can be edited or deleted by the user. The created items are listed in the module along with Edit and Delete buttons for each item. However, to extend this default module requires custom programming. A very helpful beginning guide to the custom programming that can be used to modify the default custom module is provided by Michael Washington on his Blazor Help Website . He describes how to extend the module with additional fields by adding more database migrations and then modifying the code appropriately. Based on this approach, there are a couple of additional possibilities for creating custom modules as well. Template Creation - How to create a custom template that then can be used in the custom module dropdown to create modules with the given field structure Module Modification - How to modify a custom external module that is generated to have the appropriate fields Either of these approaches should work and the differences are minor. Probably in most cases the Module Modification is preferable since you will end up with an external module that can be copied and used by others. The Template Creation approach also creates an external module, but it requires some extra steps. These approaches work well for multiple fields being added for a given customization. Creating Documentation To create this documentation, someone can first compile this documentation on their local computer. Then they can use GIT to post the result to their own github repository using the followng commands. git add . git commit git push If someone has an IIS server to host this documentation, they can then pull the code from the github repo with the command 'git pull' under the directory where the documentation is hosted. After restarting the IIS server for that website, the new documentation should be displayed, perhaps after the cache for the browser has been cleared."

    "keywords": "MyLabBook Documentation Goals for MyLabBook We are building an open source Research Platform for the future, beginning with focusing on an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN). We especially have in mind those in the academic or startup communities who may be financially constrained but have the time and interest in using and helping to build a robust ELN for their own unique research and/or teaching needs. Our goal is to incorporate best practices that will lead to an outstanding ELN for the research community. Our main goals include the following. Free and open source with a liberal license Fast and easy to install Cross platform (Linux, Windows, Mac) Minimize the learning curve for immediate productivity Maximize the speed and productivity of development Easily customizable for any research project Excellent documentation for installation, customization, and for the internal architecture Built on widely supported technical foundations Accuracy in scientific and technical computations Scale from Raspberry Pi up through sophisticated cloud computing Integrate with widely used research software packages as simply as possible Build on a strong open source community Have an efficient runtime Our Solution In trying to meet these goals there are always trade-offs. Assessing the possibilities, we have decided to use the Oqtane framework for MyLabBook going forward**. Oqtane is a relatively young framework, but it has some fairly unique characteristics. Blazor provides the following advantages. The front end (i.e., the browser interface) is developed with C#, the same language used for the server side code. Utilizes WASM in the browser, opening up many previously unavailable computational possibilities Productive environment through simplified component building Long term support from Microsoft Liberal Apache license Excellent free and paid development environments (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider) Cross platform (Linux, Window, Mac) The Oqtane framework provides the additional advantages. Micro-frontend allowing multiple backend sources. This will be useful for utilizing different scientific packages on the backend with a common interface in the browser. Developed by a team with experience building DNN , the most successful open source .NET content management system to date Themeable Supports multiple databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite) Highly extensible through independent modules Liberal MIT license Documentation Contents This documentation for MyLabBook is structured as follows. Overview contains information about the overall project, concepts, building the documentation, and article and video links Administration Manuals has instructions for administrators Development has information about the structure of the Oqtane code and default custom modules and how to make your own modules Examples has various examples for how you might extend MyLabBook for your own use Code Documentation is extracted from the source code and organized for easy access To work on the docs, read up on how the docs work ** Note that this direction in development is a change from our use of the Drupal CMS for an ELN for the past 14 years"

    "keywords": "Oqtane Concepts: DLL Handling How / Why DLLs are loaded into memory: the .NET Core philosophy is to only load the specific assemblies an app needs ( to reduce startup time and memory ) by default .NET Core will only load assemblies statically linked to the main app - it will not load every DLL in the /bin it will not load Oqtane module/theme DLLs as these are dynamically linked therefore Oqtane needs to manually load its modules/themes in order to do this it needs to be able to quickly identify the DLLs the only option available is via filename, as any other approach requires reflection which consumes startup time/processing and memory the convention is that the filename must contain oqtane once the required DLLs are loaded into the AppDomain, subsequent operations for assemblies can use the AppDomain rather than the file system the majority of assemblies in the AppDomain are not relevant to Oqtane reflection is expensive so we should only use reflection on assemblies which are actually relevant to Oqtane assembly fullname is same as DLL filename, so we can look for the oqtane qualifier to identify Oqtane assemblies"

Therefore, from a conceptual viewpoint, it has the same multiple hierarchical levels as for an Oqtane installation. These hierarchical levels are summarized below. Host - The highest level. There is only one host per MyLabBook instance. To change settings for a host, a user needs to have the Host Users role. Site - The second highest level. There can be one or more sites within a host because MyLabBook has a multitenant architecture. The Host Users and Administrators roles have privileges to change settings for a site. Page - The third highest level. There can be one or more pages within a site. The Host Users and Administrators roles have privileges to change settings and content for a page. Module - The fourth highest level. There can be one or more modules within a page. The Host Users and Administrators roles have privileges to change settings for a module and to create a new module. This hierarchy is illustrated below. Note that this diagram is also the inspiration for the graphic seen on the right side of heading bars throughout this documentation.

Because of this, we use a special trick where a javascript in layout\\oqtane\\toc.extension.js optimizes the names based on some rules. Here's what it does The prefix Oqtane. is removed by default (unless that's all there is) If the remaining namespace has more than 2 parts, it will be truncated with a prefix ... to make it fit better 😎 In addition, it looks up if the namespace has metadata (in the namespace-metadata.js ) to give it better colors and icons."

Adding Extensive Documentation Let's assume you have a class Oqtane.Example.MyClass and you would like to add images and a lot of markdown to explain what it does. This is your code: /// <summary> /// This class does something /// </summary> public class MyClass { } Now go to the documentation project Oqtane.Docs in the solution and open the apidoc\\Example folder (create it, if it doesn't exist yet'). In this, create a MyClass.md file which contains this --- uid: Oqtane.Example.MyClass --- Here is some **great** additional [Information](https://oqtane.org). 1. Do this 1. Then that Because you have the uid: ... header in your file, docfx will now combine these documentations in the output. You can also add images, html, or whatever you need. You can also find examples of this merge in the apidoc\\Documentation\\PublicApi.md file. Documenting Namespaces It's usually very helpful to document what a namespace does.

    "keywords": "How the Documentation System Works The initial configuration starts with the docfx.json file. Basically this says what code it should pick up, where the .md files are and where to put the output. We've tried to make it very clear where we made relevant changes and smuggled comment-nodes into the file for clarity. Layout The layout is configured in the docfx.json where it will start with the default template, extend it with statictoc (generate real html menu-structures, not just JS) and then apply the layout specified in layout\\oqtane . It will also include images in layout\\images like logos etc. because this was configured in docfx.json . Site Navigation The site navigation is cascaded through the toc.yml files in each folder. Tip You may also find examples online which use toc.md files but you'll run into requirements that will force you to switch back to YAML. So we recommend you stick to the yaml format everywhere. What Code is included in the Docs The initial set is configured in the docfx.json with the base path cwd and include/filter files. Then we have a few basic rules, which are all configured in the filterConfig.yml file. Ignore all Microsoft.* , System.* and Oqtane.Test.* namespaces Troubleshooting Problems with MSBuild or .net SDK Docfx runs MSBuild to compile the projects it finds. This can easily cause trouble if your Dev-PC has been through various versions of Visual-Studio. If you need to troubleshoot this, best contact iJungleboy on Github. Problems with Old / Unexpected Results MSBuild will compile everyting into the obj folder of this docs-project. This is used as a cache for the next builds. If you run into unexpected results, always clean out the obj folder first. Problems with Github links Docfx automatically links all the auto-generated docs with the git-repo. So make sure that the oqtane.framework is pulled from the official location https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework - otherwise the links will point to another repo."

The Basics The MyLabBook.Docs project generates the documentation for MyLabBook using docfx . The generator will compile all of MyLabBook and create an output into ../docs . Note that this docs project is outside of the normal oqtane.framework repo structure, because it's meant to be deployed to a separate repo https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.docs and then hosted on https://docs.oqtane.org Important Considerations As of now (September 2020) docfx in Visual Studio still requires the full .net framework; a port to .net core is almost complete. For this reason, documentation generation currently still requires a windows PC. We'll transition to full .net core docs when docfx is ready, probably Q1 2021."

It is based on the Oqtane framework and uses reusable web UI components that are implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both the client and server code is written in C#, providing a consistent and efficient development experience. Blazing a New Trail Since MyLabBook is based on Oqtane, it utilizes Blazor, the revolutionary new development framework from Microsoft that lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. MyLabBook supports both the Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly hosting models. Open Source MyLabBook is available under the industry standard MIT open source license. Cross Platform MyLabBook is a native .NET Core application and can be used on all major enterprise IT platforms. It currently supports SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL databases. Modular Architecture MyLabBook has a modular architecture which allows it to serve as an integration fabric for building composite applications. Because it is built on the Oqtane framework, MyLabBook can be easily extended with custom modules and themes. Modules are created as standard .NET Core applications using Blazor components for the UI and can be developed, packaged and installed independently from the Oqtane framework. The framework utilizes open web UI standards (ie. HTML and CSS3) as well as Bootstrap 5 as the default CSS framework for creating modern user experiences. Multi-Tenant MyLabBook can serve the needs of multiple clients from a single installation. It supports both shared and isolated tenancy models to enable you to comply with data privacy regulations. Composite UI MyLabBook provides the capability for an admnistrator to dynamically construct a page from existing components without writing any code. Headless API MyLabBook provides a rich set of secure REST-based core APIs which can be leveraged in custom modules. Swagger integration is included by default to simplify API integration."
