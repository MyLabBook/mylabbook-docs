### Top Navigation

MyLabBook has two different [theme possibilities](../host-administration/theme-management.html) in the default installation - the Oqtane theme or the Blazor theme. 
For either of these themes, the upper right part of the header of any given page displays the login name for the currently logged in user and a link for logging out of the site. 
This is displayed in the annotated screenshot below.

If the logged-in user is an [Administrator](../site-administration/role-management.html), then two icons are also displayed on the right side of the header. 
Clicking on the left pencil icon allows the Administrator to edit the page that is currently being displayed. 
Clicking on the right gear icon brings up the [Control Panel](./control-panel.html) as a slideout on the right. 
From the [Control Panel](./control-panel.html) you can open the [Admin Dashboard](./admin-dashboard.html) as well as manage pages and modules.
