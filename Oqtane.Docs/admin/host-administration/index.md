# Host Administration

![hostadminbanner](./assets/host-admin-banner.png)

The host user has the highest possible level of permissions in a MyLabBook instance and can manage any individual site, set defaults for the creation of new sites, 
and manage additional configurations that support all sites.

An MyLabBook site administrator is primarily concerned with the look, feel, functionality, and content of a site. A host is more concerned with the configuration, 
performance, monitoring, and support of the entire MyLabBook instance. As the MyLabBook host (or any user with superuser permissions), you need to have a working grasp 
of all the features and configuration options available to you.

A host logs into a MyLabBook site just like any other user, just using the host account that is created when the MyLabBook application is first launched.

In addition to the site options discussed in the site administration [control panel](../control-panel/index.md) and [admin dashboard](../admin-dashboard/index.md), 
the host account has more options than an administrator account in the admin dashboard, which includes:

* **Event Log** - Which contain information on various events that have occurred on the site like errors or anything that has been created, updated, or deleted with more 
info on [event log](event-log.md).
* **Site Management** - Which allows for the addition and modififation for all of the different sites you have with more info on [site management](site-management.md).
* **Module Management** - Which allows you to install new modules and edit existing modules with more info on [module management](module-management.md).
* **Theme Management** - Which allows you to install new themes to change the look of you webpages with more info on [theme management](theme-management.md).
* **Scheduled Jobs** - Which allows for the creation of jobs that will do something every time a specified amount of time passes with more info on [scheduled jobs](scheduled-jobs.md).
* **SQL Management** - Which lets you run SQL queries in your databases with more info on [sql management](sql-management.md).
* **System Info** - Gives information on your verion of the MyLabBook framework and allows you to see information and methods in MyLabBook's api with more info on [system info](system-info.md).
* **System Update** - Allows you to keep MyLabBook up to date and allow you to use NuGet packages with more info on [system update](system-update.md).
